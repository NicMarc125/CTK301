			<h2>Nick Marchigiani vs. The World</h2>
			<p>This was a project where I green screened myself into a movie! The green screen was so weird because it was a BRICK WALL!!! That was quite annoying so I had to go all in on the editing to control thr contrast and cropping of the screen. I still am very proud of this project, becauce comparing it to other projects at the time it was way past that! An example of pushing myself against my limits :D</p>

			<h2>Gearigiani's Kitchen</h2>
			<p>This project was making a cooking show and me and my friend Sean Gearman did this one together! I edited this video and Sean and I filed it together switching between angles and such, but I like how the jokes convey during the editing and the instrumentals in the background of the video. This video was quite long, but I really like the whole vibe, feel, and effort put into this video! </p>

			<h2>The Great Beast of War</h2>
			<p>This asignment was putting a narritive together through photos! I worked with three other people, it was a fun story we came up with and I really enjoyed the set pieces of this one specially! I thought it was cool creating the terrian of Namvieta and putting this diagram together to create a silly yet cohesive story! </p>

			<h2>My sister took my Wii controller, so now I cant play Smash Bros Brawl</h2>
			<p>This was made for extra credit in one of my classes! I wanted to make a sad emotionally charged ballad over something really inconviet! My sister (love her) would always have to be player 1 when it came to our Wii so I channeled some of that energy into this piece. This song release was also after infinity city and I was trying out alot more different styles and I wanted to experiment with syncing up audio and video!</p>

			<h2>Improv Jazz</h2>
			<p>This was for a project my freshman year of college, and technically my first live performance at ISU. It was a realy fun project, because me and Jojo just played some jazz out in the quad and anybody could of just came by and listened to us! </p>
